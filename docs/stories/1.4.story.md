# Story 1.4: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-11-17

---

## Story Statement

As a **developer**,
I want **automated testing and deployment pipeline**,
so that **code changes are validated and deployed consistently without manual steps**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow created for backend: runs on push to main and pull requests
2. Backend CI workflow runs: `npm install`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`
3. GitHub Actions workflow created for mobile: runs linting and type-checking (build on device/simulator not required in CI for MVP)
4. Linting configured with ESLint for both backend and mobile with consistent rules
5. Unit test framework configured with Jest for backend
6. CI pipeline fails if linting, tests, or build fails
7. CD pipeline configured to deploy backend to AWS (ECS or App Runner) on successful main branch build
8. Environment variables for production are securely stored in GitHub Secrets or AWS Parameter Store
9. Deployment includes database migration execution before new code version starts
10. Deployment pipeline includes smoke test (health check endpoint) after deployment

---

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3 established authentication system with JWT tokens
- Build system working with NestJS (`nest build`) producing `dist/` directory
- All dependencies properly locked via npm workspaces
- Monorepo structure stable with apps/api and apps/mobile

### Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture
**Source: docs/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice**

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (eu-central-1 region for Bulgaria proximity)
- **Compute:** Amazon ECS or AWS App Runner for Docker container deployment
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker containerization required
- **Deployment Method:** GitHub Actions (specified in architecture)
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs and metrics available
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry integration available (future)

**Key Decision:** GitHub Actions is explicitly chosen for CI/CD in the architecture document.

### Repository Structure
**Source: docs/architecture.md#Repository Structure**

Monorepo with npm workspaces structure:
```
kash-budget/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # NestJS backend (Story 1.3 completed)
│   └── mobile/       # React Native (Story 1.3 partially done)
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/       # Shared types
│   └── config/       # Shared configuration
```

Workspace configuration allows bulk operations:
- `npm run build --workspaces` - Builds all packages
- `npm run test --workspaces` - Tests all packages
- `npm run lint --workspaces` - Lints all packages (not yet configured)

### Backend Testing Strategy
**Source: docs/architecture.md (general patterns)**

- **Framework:** Jest (already in package.json devDependencies: ^29.7.0)
- **Backend Location:** `apps/api/`
- **Test Configuration:** Already has `jest.config.js` reference in package.json
- **E2E Tests:** Config references `test/jest-e2e.json`
- **Test Command:** `npm run test` (defined in apps/api/package.json)

Backend package.json includes:
- `jest`: ^29.7.0
- `ts-jest`: ^29.1.1
- `supertest`: ^6.3.3 (HTTP testing library)
- `@nestjs/testing`: ^10.2.10 (NestJS test utilities)

### Linting Configuration
**Source: docs/architecture.md (coding standards reference)**

- **Linter:** ESLint (already in devDependencies: ^8.54.0)
- **Parser:** @typescript-eslint/parser: ^6.13.2
- **Plugin:** @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: ^6.13.2
- **Lint Script:** Already defined as `npm run lint` in apps/api/package.json

Current lint script: `eslint "{src,apps,libs}/**/*.ts" --fix`

Needs configuration for:
- ESLint config file (.eslintrc.json or .eslintrc.cjs)
- Mobile app linting rules
- Shared linting rules across monorepo

### Existing Build Infrastructure
**Source: Apps built in Stories 1.1-1.3**

Backend API:
- **Build Tool:** NestJS CLI (`nest build`)
- **Output:** `apps/api/dist/` directory
- **Built Script:** Already defined `npm run build` in apps/api/package.json
- **Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully with zero TypeScript errors
- **Artifacts:** Compiled JavaScript in dist/ with source maps

Mobile App:
- **Build Tool:** React Native CLI or Expo
- **Configuration:** apps/mobile/package.json includes React Native dependencies
- **Build Status:** Not yet tested in Stories 1.1-1.3

### GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements
**Source: docs/architecture.md + Acceptance Criteria**

**Backend Workflow** (.github/workflows/backend.yml):
- Trigger: On push to `main` branch and all pull requests
- Node version: 20.x (matches engine requirement in package.json)
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js 20.x
  3. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
  4. Run linting (`npm run lint --workspace=apps/api`)
  5. Run tests (`npm run test --workspace=apps/api`)
  6. Run build (`npm run build --workspace=apps/api`)
  7. (CD) Upload build artifacts to AWS
  8. (CD) Deploy to AWS ECS/App Runner
  9. (CD) Run smoke test (GET /api/health)

**Mobile Workflow** (.github/workflows/mobile.yml):
- Trigger: On push to `main` branch and all pull requests
- Node version: 20.x
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js 20.x
  3. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
  4. Run linting (`npm run lint --workspace=apps/mobile`)
  5. Run type-checking (likely via `tsc --noEmit` or similar)

### AWS Deployment Configuration
**Source: docs/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice**

- **Service:** ECS (Elastic Container Service) or AWS App Runner (simpler option for MVP)
- **Container:** Docker image built from Dockerfile
- **Region:** eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
- **Environment Management:** GitHub Secrets for sensitive vars (JWT_SECRET, DB_PASSWORD, etc.)
- **Alternative:** AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for non-secrets

Required Secrets to configure in GitHub:
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION` (eu-central-1)
- `ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME` (if using ECS)

### Database Migration Execution
**Source: docs/architecture.md + Acceptance Criteria**

- **Migration Tool:** TypeORM (already configured in Story 1.2)
- **Trigger:** During deployment, before application start
- **Command Reference:** apps/api/package.json includes `migration:run` script
- **Safety:** Migrations should be idempotent and tested locally first

Deploy flow:
1. Build Docker image with migrations included
2. Push image to AWS ECR
3. Update ECS task definition with new image
4. Run migrations: `npm run migration:run`
5. Start application: `npm start`

### Health Check Smoke Test
**Source: docs/architecture.md + Story 1.2**

- **Endpoint:** GET /api/health
- **Expected Response:** `{"status": "ok", "database": "connected"}`
- **HTTP Status:** 200 for success, 503 for database failure
- **Implementation:** Already completed in Story 1.2

Post-deployment smoke test flow:
1. Wait for deployment to complete (ECS task running)
2. Make HTTP request to `/api/health`
3. Verify response is 200 and `status: "ok"`
4. Fail deployment if health check fails

  - Expose port 3000
  - Health check: `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || exit 1`
  - Entrypoint: `npm start` or `node dist/main.js`
- Test locally: `docker build -t kash-api . && docker run -p 3000:3000 kash-api`

- Security note: Secrets never logged or exposed in workflow output
- Document where each secret is used in workflow files
- Verification: Run workflow with secrets, confirm no exposed values in logs
- **Source Reference:** [docs/architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

**Task 9: Create Unit Test Example** (AC: 5)
- Write sample Jest test: `apps/api/src/health/health.service.spec.ts`
- Test health check logic without database
- Use @nestjs/testing utilities
- Verify test runs with `npm run test --workspace=apps/api`
