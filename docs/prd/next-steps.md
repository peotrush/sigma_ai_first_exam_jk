# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

"Please review this PRD and create a comprehensive design system and wireframes for Kash Budget. Focus on the 3-screen minimal interface (Scan / See / Save), Kash character integration, and the Treat Yourself category visual differentiation. The design should embody 'Intelligent Invisible' principles—simple, warm, and encouraging. Deliverables: design system documentation, high-fidelity mockups for all core screens, and interaction design specifications."

## Architect Prompt

"Please review this PRD and create a comprehensive technical architecture document for Kash Budget. Define the system architecture (React Native mobile app + NestJS backend + PostgreSQL), API specifications, database schema, authentication flow, QR parsing implementation, geofencing strategy, ML categorization approach, and deployment architecture on AWS. Ensure the architecture supports the 10-second interaction requirement, 95% QR accuracy, and scalability to 10,000 users. Deliverables: architecture document with diagrams, API contract specifications, database ERD, and deployment pipeline design."
